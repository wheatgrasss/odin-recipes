        <ul>Ingredients
            <li>2 oyster steaks</li>
            <li>1 tbsp high-heat cooking oil (like olive or avocado)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef stock or broth</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the steaks</strong>. Pat the oyster steaks completely <br>
                dry with a paper towel. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>Sear the steaks</strong>. Place the steaks in the hot pan and <br>
                sear for 1–2 minutes per side for a thin cut, or 3–4 minutes for a <br>
                thicker steak, until a nice crust forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear the steaks</strong>. Place the steaks in the hot pan and <br>
                sear for 1–2 minutes per side for a thin cut, or 3–4 minutes for a <br>
                thicker steak, until a nice crust forms.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add aromatics</strong>. When you flip the steaks for the final <br>
                sear, add the butter, minced garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the pan. <br>
                Baste the steaks with the melted butter and herb mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finish cooking</strong>. For medium-rare doneness, cook the <br>
                steaks until the internal temperature reaches 135°F, using a meat thermometer.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Rest the steaks</strong>. Transfer the steaks to a clean plate <br>
                and tent them loosely with foil to rest for 10 minutes. This allows the <br>
                juices to redistribute for a tender, juicy result.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Create the pan sauce</strong>. While the steaks are resting, add <br>
                the beef stock to the hot pan and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. <br>
                Continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced slightly.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>. Slice the rested steak thinly against the grain and <br>
                pour the pan sauce over the top. </li>
        </ol>
